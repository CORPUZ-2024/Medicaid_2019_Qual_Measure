# Medicaid_2019_Qual_Measure
**Active Project**</p>
Visualization Project on the [2019 Medicaid Quality Measure Dataset](https://data.medicaid.gov/Quality/2019-Child-and-Adult-Health-Care-Quality-Measures-/afrw-yks2) 

## This visualization project has the following design goals: 
### Overview Across all Measure Types by State (View A)
CMS has simple visualizations on this dataset where viewers are able to select a certain state and Measure name. However this feature requires multiple visualizations for one arbitraty state. Hence, a practical view that can compliment what is already available online is one that offers a 'snapshot' of each state by measure name so that a viewer can easily spot measure names where the state is falling behind or doing well on. </p> 

**Sample Visual:**
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29220349/131366354-5e957cb5-01fe-4218-8535-f431b9bb1adf.JPG" width="90%"></img> </p> 
Through this view, stakeholders can easily spot the Measures in a given domain where a given state is falling behind. 
 
### Overview Across all States by Measure  Type (View B) 
Another valuable view is one that can show a 'snapshot' of all the states relative to a specific measure type where the states are arranged in ascending or descending order. This way, viewers can see the group of states that are in the top, median and bottom quartiles in terms of state rank.
